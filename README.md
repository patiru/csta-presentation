This is where I will share content and links for my 2018 CSTA presentation:
5 Ways to Encourage Young Women &amp; URM to Participate in CS and Engineering 

Program Overview/Abstract:

Despite their significant contributions, women and underrepresented minorities continue to be underrepresented in computer science and technology related fields. The lack of diversity in technology related fields is problematic as it can result in the perpetuation of negative stereotypes and closed-minded, unchecked biases. This session will present the research and findings from my 2017 phenomenological, interview-based, study designed to investigate the lived experience of women in undergraduate computer science and engineering programs. The purpose of the study was to better understand the factors that might encourage or discourage the participation of women in the major and in the field.

This session will focus on exploring five ways to support young women and underrepresented minorities in pursuing in college CS and Engineering. Practical examples of how each element is experienced by students will be shared and relevant ways to implement the five elements at your school will be shared and discussed. The elements in the presentation are grounded in current learning theories and Cyberlearning research.
